# Heart Disease Prediction

End-to-End Machine Learning Project for predicting risk of coronary heart disease in patients using their cuurent and past medical conditions.
 

## Getting Started

This project is built on Python 3.8.5 mainly using Jupyter lab and other DS libraries like pandas, sklearn etc.

### Prerequisites

I would recommend to create a new virtual environment as it's always a good practice to use seperate environements for separate projects and not mix up diffrent libraries with diffrent versions. I have used virtualenv for that purpose.

  ```sh
  pip3 install virtualenv
  python3 -m virtualenv <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
  source <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>/bin/activate
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/itsrandeep/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install Required Libraries
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the Jupyter server
   ```sh
   jupyter lab
   ```
